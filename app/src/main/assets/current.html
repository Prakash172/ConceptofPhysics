<h4>Electric Current :</h4> 
It is the rate of flow of Electric Charges or Electrons, Denoted By: ' I '.<br>
$$I = {Q(Charge)}/{T(Time)}$$<br>
>Scalar Quantity.<br>
>S.I Unit = Ampere(A).<br>
$$1A= {1Columb}/{1Second} = {CS^{-1}.$$<br>
<h4>Ammeter :</h4>
It is a Current Measuring Device.<br>

$1mA = 10^{-3}A$<br>
$1μA = 10^{-6}A$<br>
<h4>Instantaneous Current :</h4>
It is the Current in any Circuit of wire at a particular instant of time.<br>
$I = {dq}/{dt}$.<br>
Que : If the charge flowing in a wire is function of time $q = 4t^3+3t^2+2t+1$.<br>

dq =I*dt<br>
$I={dq}/{dt}$<br>
differentiate charge w.r.t to time.<br>
${dq}/{dt} = I = 12t^2+6t+2$<br>
at t=3<br>
$I = 12(3)^2+6(3)+2 = 128A.$<br>
at t=100<br>

  Ans : Increased by 4 times means<br>
   l' = l + 4l = 5l<br>
 A' = $A/5$ (A' = $A/n$)<br>
 R' = ρ${5l}/{A/5}$ = 25ρ$l/A$ = 25*R = 25 * 5 = 125Ω.<br>

 <h4>wheat stone Bridge Principle :</h4>
    <img src="file:///android_asset/images/current/wheat.jpg" ,width="60" ,height="70"/><br>
 According to Wheatstone bridge Principle when 4 resistors P,Q,R and S are connected in bridge and adjusted in such a way that the current through the Galvanometer becomes 0 ($I_g$ = 0) then $P/Q = R/S$.<br>
 <h5>Proof:-</h5>
 In ABDA (KVL)<br>
 $I_1P+I_gG-(I-I_1)R$ = 0------eq.1<br>
 In BCDB (KVL)<br>
 $(I_1-I_g)Q - (I-I_1+I_g)S - I_gG$ = 0------eq.2<br>
 By adjusting one of two resistance say 'R' in such a way so that the $I_g$ becomes 0.<br>
 i.e Galvanometer gives 0 Deflection.<br>
 Rewrite eq.1<br>
 $I_1P = (I - I_1)R$-------eq.3<br>
Rewrite eq.2<br>
$I_1Q = (I - I_1)S$-------eq.4<br>
divide eq.3 by eq.4<br>
${I_1P}/{I_1Q} = {(I - I_1)R}/{(I - I_1)S}$<br>
[$P/Q = R/S$].<br>
Que : Under What Condition Wheatstone Bridge Becomes Sensitive?<br>
Ans : When all the 4 capacitors & resistors are adjusted in such a way that they have the same value = [P=Q=R=s].<br>
<h4>Meter Bridge :</h4>
    <img src="file:///android_asset/images/current/meter.jpg" ,width="60" ,height="70"/><br>
A Mete Bridge is an electric device which is used to caculate  the unknown Resistance & Resistivity of a wire.<br>
It consist of 1m standard Resistance wire across the scale. A Null point (0-deflection) is detected through the Galvanometer on the wire.<br>
As the jockey is slided over meter bridge wire a null point is detected at length l. The G gives 0-deflection.<br>
Let r - resistance per unit length<br>
Resistance of length 'l' = lr = P<br>
Resistance of remaining wire = (100-l) = (100-l)r =Q<br>
As $P/Q = R/S$<br>
${lr}/{(100-l)r} = R/S$<br>
S =${(100-l)}/l$R<br>
<h4>Potentio Meter :</h4>
    <img src="file:///android_asset/images/current/potentiometer.jpg" ,width="50" ,height="50"/><br>
PotentioMeter is a electric device which is used to measure the accurate EMF of the cell and also the internal resistance of the cell.<br>

It consist of 4m standard resistance wire in series connected through the copper stripes to the auxilary circuit.<br>
<h4>Principle of PotentioMeter :</h4>
According to Principle of potentiometer the voltage or the potential difference is directly proportional to the length across the potentioMeter wire.<br>
V∝l<br>
V = Kl [K = potential gradiant]<br>
K = $V/l$<br>
S.I unit = ${volt}/{meter}$ = $vm^{-1}$.<br>
    <img src="file:///android_asset/images/current/vlgraph.png" ,width="50" ,height="50"/><br>
[$K = tanθ = V/l$]<br>
>>K is constant in potentiometer wire only.<br>
<h4>Sensitivity Of PotentioMeter :</h4>
    <img src="file:///android_asset/images/current/abtable.png" ,width="50" ,height="50"/><br>
B is more sensitive as the 'K' is small for B.<br>
Sensitivity: Means, the value of 'k' should be less.<br>
<h5>To Increase The Sensitivity of PotentioMeter :- </h5>
As K =$V/l$ , by increasing the length of potentiometer wire ,we can decrease the value of K.<br>
If length is fixed by decreasing the current with help of Rheostat.<br><br>

    <img src="file:///android_asset/images/current/application.png" ,width="50" ,height="50"/><br>
  >> $E_1$ = coonected<br>
  As the jockey is slided at length 'l' null point is detected.<br>
  $E_1 ∝ l_1$<br>
  $E_1 = Kl_1$--------1<br>
  >> $E_2$ = coonected<br>
  As teh jockey slide at length '$l_2$' null point detected.<br>
  $E_2 ∝ l_2$<br>
  $E_2 = Kl_2$--------2<br>
  divide 2 by 1<br>
  ${E_2}/{E_1} = {l_2}/{l_1}$  or ${E_1}/{E_2} = {l_1}/{l_2}$  <br><br>
  2. To find the internal resistance of a cell by potentiometer.<br>
  E' = Driver cell     E = Measuring cell.<br>
    <img src="file:///android_asset/images/current/app2.jpg" ,width="50" ,height="50"/><br>
>>E cell is connected & Rbox is disconnected<br>
As the jockey is slided over potentiometer wire at length 'l' null pointer is detected.<br>
E ∝ $l_1$<br>
E = K $l_1$-------1<br>
>>E is connected & Rbox is also coonected<br>
As the current starts from measuring cell an internal resistance 'r' comes in circuit to 1<br>
Again jockey is slided at length '$l_2$' null point detected.<br>
V ∝ $l_2$<br>
V = K$l_2$--------2<br>

<h5>Kirchoff's Second Law :-</h5>
According to it, the sum of the potential difference in a closed circuit is always zero. It a llop rule because it's always followed in closed path. It is based on law of conservation of energy.<br>

<h6>Sign-Convention :-</h6>
>> If the closed path is along the current then current (I) will be +ve and the EMF of the battery will be taken -ve.<br>
>> If the closed path is opposite the current then current (I) will be -ve and the EMF of the battery will be taken +ve.<br>
