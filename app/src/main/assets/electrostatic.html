	<h2>Types of charge</h2>
	<p>An electric charge is of two types.</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Positive charge</li>
		<li>Negative charge</li>
	</ol>
	<h3>Positive charge:</h3>Positive charge is represented by +Q or +q and has a high density of protons.
	<h3>Negative charge:</h3>Negative charge is represented by -Q or -q and has a high density of electrons.
	<p>#Like charges repel each other. Examples:</p>
	<p>1.A glass rod is rubbed with silk cloth.</p>
	<p>2.A plastic rod rubbed with woolen cloth the plastic rod is negatively charged.</p>
	<p>#Unlike charges attract each other.Example:</p>
	<p>A glass rod rubbed with silk cloth and a plastic rod rubbed with woolen cloth.</p>
	<p>#Fundamental properties of electric charge</p>
	<p>1.Additivity of charges</p>
	<p>2.Conservation of charges</p>
	<p>3.Quantisation of charges</p>
	<p>1. Additivity of charges: As electric charge is a scalar quantity it can add like numbers.<br> Example: $q_1$ = 6 and $q_2$=
		-20
		<br>q = $q_1$ + $q_2$= 6 - 20 = -14
		<p>2. Conservation of charge: In an isolated system the total charge remains conserved i.e. the charge can be transferred
			from one body to the other body.<br> Example: $^238U_92$ $→$ $^234Th_90$ + $^4He_2$<br> 92 = 90 + 2<br> 92 = 92 conserved<br>$ϒ$
			$→$ $e^{+}↙{positron}$ + $e^{-}↙{electron}$<br> 0 $→$ e + -e = 0 conserved
			<p>3. Quantisation of charge: As charge remains discrete(particle), it can be represented by integral multiple of fundamental
				charge.
				<br> Q = ne , q = ne<br> n=$- ∞$ to $+ ∞$ except '0'.<br> Example: Find the no. of electrons in 1.6 C charge?<br> Ans:
				q = ne<br> n = ${q/e}$ = ${1.6 C}/{1.6 * {10^{-19}C}} $ = $10^19$ <br>
				<h2>Charging</h2><br>It is the phenomena in which electrification of a body takes place by 3 ways.<br>
				<ul>
					<li>charging by friction</li>
					<li>charging by conduction</li>
					<li>charging by induction</li>
				</ul>
				<h3>Charging by friction</h3> It is the phenomena in which the charging takes place by the rubbing of two bodies. Example:
				A glass rod attains +ve charge as it is rubbed with silk cloth.<br>
				<h3>Charging by conduction</h3> It is the phenomena in which the charging takes place through the wires as conductor as the
				bodies comes in physical contact.
				<br>Examples: Charging of batteries :<br> It is the most prefer way of charging.<br>
				<h3>Charging by induction</h3> It is the phenomena in which a uncharged body gets charged as it brought near to the charged
				body.
				<br> <span style="color:red">page no. 6 image 4</span> # Note Earth is Neutral have zero potential. <br>
				<h2>Uniform charge distribution</h2> It takes place in three ways
				<h3> Linear charge distribution</h3> The charge is uniformly distributed with respect to the length of the conductor.<br>
				<span style="color:red">page no. 7 image 5</span> <br> # linear charge density = {charge}/{length}<br> $λ$ = $q/l$<br>				S.I. = C $m^{-1}$<br> q = $λ$ l<br>
				<h3>Surface charge distribution</h3> The charge is uniformly distributed with respect to the surface area of body<br> # surface
				charge density = {charge}/{surface area}<br> $σ$ = $q/s$<br> S.I. = $C/m^{2}$<br> q = σ s<br>
				<h3>Volume charge density</h3> The charge is uniformly distributed with respect to volume of the body<br> # volume charge
				density = {charge}/{volume}<br>$ρ$ =$q/V$<br>S.I. = $ C/m^3$<br> Example: A wire with a charge density 6 * $10^{-6}$
				C/m of length of 3 mm. Find the charge contained by the wire.<br> Ans: l = 3 mm = 3 * $10^{-3}$ m <br> q = λ l<br> =
				6 * $10^{-6}$ * 3 * $10^{-3}$ <br> = 18 * $10^{-9}$ C <br>
				<h1> Coulomb's law in electrostatics</h1> According to coulombs law the electrostatic force betwwen two point charge is directly
				proportinal to the product of charges and inversely proportional to the square of the distance betwwen them<br> $F∝{q_1q_2}$-----------(1)
				<br>$F∝{1/r^2}$-----------(2)<br> Combining (1) and (2)<br> $F∝{q_1q_2}/r^2$
				<br>$F = {K q_1q_2}/r^2$<br> K = electrostatic or coulombs law<br> $K=1/{4πε_0}$ = 9 *$10^9$ ${Nm^2}/C^2$(Air medium)<br>				Electrostatic force depends on medium<br>$ε_0$ = Epsilon node or permitivity in free space<br> $ε_0$ = 8.85 * $10^{-12}

				air medium.<br> Ans: F=${1/{4πε_0}} {q_1q_2}/r^2<br> ${9 * 10^9 * 6 * 10^{-6} * 3 * 10^{-6}}/4^2$<br> ${54 * 3 * 10^{-3}}/4
				* 4$<br>${{81}/8}*10^{-3}$<br>$10.1 * 10^{-3}$ N<br> Example: Two charges q and 4q are separate by a distance 'r' between
				them is halfed. Find the ratio of the force between the charges.<br> Ans: F = ${1/{4πε_0}} * {q_1q_2}/r^2$<br> $F_1 =
				K *{4q^2}/r^2$
				<br> $F_2 = K *{18q^2}/{{r^2}/4}$<br> ${{F_1}/{F_2}} = {{K * 4q^2}/r^2}*{r^2}/{K * 4 * 18q^2}$<br> ${F_1/F_2} = 1/18$<br>				$F_1:F_2 = 1:18$<br>
				<h3>Characteristics of electrostatic force</h3><br>
				<ol>

					<li>It is a conservative force.</li>
					<li>It is a central force.</li>

					<li>It follows Newton's third law of motion($F↙{12} = - F↙{21})</li>
					<li>It is stronger than gravitational force and weeaker than nuclear force. </li>
					<li>It depends on the medium and it is between point charges.</li>
