    <img src="file:///android_asset/images/radian.png" height="80px" width="150px" align="center" />
    <p>
        From the above figure we know that  , for small value of θ , <br>$θ = l/r$ radian <br>
        for one radian  l = r.
    </p>
    <h3>Steradian</h3>
    <img src="file:///android_asset/images/stradian.png"  height="80px" width="150px" align="center" >
    <p>
        It is unit of solid angle (space) . One steradian is the solid angle subtended at the center of a sphere , by that surface of sphere , which is
        equal in area , to the square of the radius of the sphere<br>
        It is denoted by <b>$d℧$</b>.
        <br>
        $$d℧ = {ds }/ {r^2}$$
    </p>
<h3>
    Advantage of SI units :
</h3>
    <p>1.SI unit is the coherent system of unit  i.e any unit can be derived from the base unit .</p>
    <p>2.SI ia a reationalise system of units . Example - for all type of energy there is only one unit , joule .</p>
    <p>3. SI is absolute system of unit .</p>
<h2>Some important practical units</h2>
<h3>Astronomical unit </h3>
    <p>It is the average distance of center of earth from center of sun .</p>
$1 AU = 1.496 * 10^11 m$
<h3>Light year</h3>
    <p>One light year is the distance travelled by the light in vaccum in one year.</p>
$$1 ly = 9.46 * 10 ^15 m $$
<h3>Parsec</h3>
    <p>One parsec is the radius of circle at center of which an arc of length 1AU subtends an angle of $1''</p>
    <img src="file:///android_asset/images/parsec.png"  height="150px" width="300px" align="center" >
    <p>$$1 AU = 1.496*10^11 m$$</p>
    <p>θ = 1sec = $1/60$ = $1/{60*60}$</p>
    <p>$r = l / θ$</p>
    <p>$$1 parsec = 3.1 * 10 ^16 m$$</p>
<p>Question : What is relation between AU,ly and parsec ?</p>
<p>$$1 ly = 6.3*10^4 AU$$</p>
<p>$$1 parsec = 3.26 ly$$</p>

<h3>Parallex method </h3>

<p>
    This is the method used to measure a large distance such as planet , stars from the earth .<br>
    What is parallex ? <br>
    Parallax is a displacement or difference in the apparent position of an object viewed along two different lines of sight, and is measured by the angle or semi-angle of inclination between those two lines.
</p>
<img src="file:///android_asset/images/parralex.png"  height="80px" width="150px" align="center">
<p>From the above picture , the first position of observation is A and second position is B, now angle ANB is sum of angles FAN and FBN
.Angle ANB is called parallactic angle or parralex angle.</p>
<p>
    $$θ(ANB) = θ_1+θ_2$$
</p>
<p>
    AN = ${AB}/θ$ , from this equation we can find the required distance.

<h3>Types of Quantities</h3>
<h4>Dimensonal constants</h4>
These are quantites whoes values is constant . ex - speed of light in vaccum.
<h4>Dimensional variables </h4>
These are the quantites whose values are variable , and they posses dimension. example , area, volume , density , velocity, force.
<h4>Dimesionless Constants</h4>
These are values whoes dimension is zero but have constant value. example , 1,2,3 , $π$ etc.
<h4>Dimensionless variables</h4>
These are the quantities whose values are variable but they do not have a dimension. example, angle , strain , specific gravity.

<h2>Applications of Dimesional analysis</h2>
<p><b>1.To find the unit of a physical quantity in a given system of units.
    </b>In dimensional formula by replacing the M , L , T by the fundamental units of required system , we get the unit of the
    physical quantity . however , sometimes to this unit we further assign some specific name.
    <br>
    $work =  force * displacement$<br>
    [w] = [ML$T^-2$]*[L] = [M${L^2}{T^{-2}}$]<br>
    So , its unit in m.k.s system by repalcing M,L,T with units is kg-$m^2$/$s^2$
    Example - unit of work is joule.
</p>
<p><b>2.To find the dimensions of physical constants and co-efficients , ex - unit of Gravitational constant G </b></p>
<p><b>3.To convert a physical quantity from one system to the other.</b><br>
    The measure of a physical quantity <b>nu</b>  = constant.<br>
    If a physical quantity X ahs a dimensional formula [${M^a}{L^b}{T^c}$] and if derived units of that physical quantity in two systems are
    [${{M_1}^a}{{L_1}^b}{{T_1}^c}$] and [${{M_2}^a}{{L_2}^b}{{T_2}^c}$] respectively and $n_1$ and $n_2$ be the numerical values
    in the two systems respectively , then ${n_1}[{u_1}] = {n_2}[{u_2}]$<br>
     => $n_1$[${{M_1}^a}{{L_1}^b}{{T_1}^c}$] =  $n_2$[${{M_2}^a}{{L_2}^b}{{T_2}^c}$]<br>
     => ${n_2} = {n_1}{[{{M_1}/{M_2}}]}^a{[{{L_1}/{L_2}}]}^b{[{{T_1}/{T_2}}]}^c$
    <br>
    Examples :<br>
    1.Conversion of newton into dyne. 1N = $10^5$dyne.<br>
    2.Convert a  energy of 1 joule into ergs . 1joule = ${10}^7$dyne<br>
    3.Find the vale of force of 100N on a system based upon the metre, kilogram and minute.<br>
    4.The velocity of sound in air is 332m/s . if the unit of length is kilometre and unit of time is in hour. what would be the velocity.<br>
    5.convert a velocity of 72km/hr into m/s .<br>
    5.If the units of force , energy and velocity are 10N,100joule , and 5m/s respectively. Find the unit of length , mass and Time .
</p>
<p><b>4.To check the dimensional correctness of a given physical relation.</b></p>
This is based on the principle of homoginity. According to this principle the dimensions of each term on the both sides of an equation must be equal.A dimensionally correct formula may be correct or incorrect.
Example : <br>Check accuracy of these equations .
1. F = ${m{v^2}}/{r^2}$<br>
2. s = ut - ${1/2}{at^2}$
3. $v^2 - u^2 = 2as$
4. T = ${1/{2π}}{√{l/g}}$
<p><b>5.To derive new relations</b>

If one knows the dependency of a physical quantity on other quantites and if dependency is of product type , then using the
method of dimensional analysis we can derive the relation between those quantities .
    <br>Example : Time period of simple pendulum</p>
<h3>Limitations of Dimensional analysis</h3>
<p>1.If the dimensions are given , physicall quantity may not be unique as many physical quantites have same dimensions . ex energy and work</p><br>
2.Numerical constants having no dimensions cannot be deduced by the mehtod of dimensions.<br>
3.The method of Dimensions can not be used to derive ralations other than product of power functions.for example<br>
s = ut - ${1/2}{at^2}$<br>
$v^2 - u^2 = 2as$ cannot be derived using dimensional analysis.<br>
4.The method of Dimensions cannot be applied to derive formula if in mechanics a physical quantity depends on more  than 3 physical quantities
as then there will be less number of equations than unknown.example<br>
T = 2π$√{I/{mgl}}$<br>
5.If a physical quantity depends on 3 physical quantites , out of which two have same dimensions, the formula cannot be derived by the theory of dimensions.

<h2>Significant Figures</h2>
Significant figures in the measured value of a physical quantity tell the number of digits in which we have confidence.
<h3>Points to find significant figure</h3>
<ul>
    <li>All non-zero digits are significant figure.</li>
    <li>A zero becomes significant figure if it appears between two non-zero digits.</li>
    <li>Leading zeros or the zeros placed to the left of number are never significant.</li>
    <li>Trailing zeros or the zeros placed to right of the number are significant.</li>
    <li>In exponential notation , the numerical portion gives the number of significant figures.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Rounding off rules </h3>
<ol>
    <li>If the digits to be dropped is less than 5 , then preceding digit is left unchanged.</li>
    <li>If the digits to be the dropped is more than 5, then the preceding digit is raised by one.</li>
    <li>If the digits to be dropped is 5 followed by digits other than zero, then the preceding digit is raised by one.</li>
    <li>If the digits to be dropped is 5 or 5 follwed by zeros , then preceding digit is left unchanged , if it is even.</li>
    <li>If digit to be dropped is 5 or 5 followed by zeros , then the preceding digit is raised by one , if it is odd.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Significant figure in calculation</h3>
1.The result of addition or subtraction in the number having different precisions should be reported to same number of decimal places
as present in the number having least number of decimal places .
2. The answer to a multiplication or division is rounded off to the same number of significant figres as possesed by the least precise termused in the calculation.
<h1>Part IV</h1>
<h2>Errors of Measurement</h2>
<p>The measuring process is essentitally a process of comparision. Inspite of [our best efforts, the measured value of a quantity is always
somewhat different from its actual value, or true value .The difference in the measured value and true value is called error of measurement.</p>

<h3>1.Absolute error </h3>
<p>Absolute error in the measurement of a physical quantity is the magnitude of the difference between the true value and the measured value of the quantity.</p>
<p>Let a physical quantity be measured n times. Let the measured values be $a_1,a_2,a_3.....a_n$. The<i>arithmetic mean</i>of these values is ${a_m} = {a_1+a_2+a_3.....a_n}/n$.</p>
By defination , absolute errors in the measured values of the quantity are<br>
$Δa_1 = a_m - a_1$<br>
$Δa_2 = a_m - a_2$<br>
$Δa_3 = a_m - a_3$<br>
.................
<hr>
$Δa_n = a_m - a_n$ . <br>
The absolutte error maybe positive and negative.
<h3>2.Mean absolute error</h3>
It is arithemetic mean of the magnitudes of absolute errors in the all measurements of the quantity.It is represented by $\ov{Δa}$.<br>
$\ov{Δa}$ = ${|Δa_1|+|Δa_2|+|Δa_3|.....|Δa_n|}/n$ <br>
Hence the final result of the measurement maybe written as a = $a_m +↙{-}\ov{Δa}$.
<h3>3.Relative error or Fractional error</h3>
The relative error of measurement is defined as the ratio of mean absolute error to the mean value of quntity measured.
$$Relative error = {Mean absolute error} / {Mean value} = {\ov{Δa}}/a_m$$
<h3>4.Percentage error</h3>
When the relative or fraction error is repesented in percentage , it is called Percentage error.
Percentage  error = ${\ov{Δa}}/{a_m}*100%$
<h2>Propagation of errors</h2>
<p>
    Case :<b>x = a + b </b><br>
    let absolute error in a is Δa and in b Δb , then <br>
    1.absolute error in calulation of x is Δx(sum of a and b).<br>
    2.The maximum error in x =  = +-(Δa + Δb) .<br>
    3.Percentage error in value of x =  = ${(Δa + Δb)}/{a+b}$*100% .<br><br>
    Case :<b>x = a - b </b><br>
    let absolute error in a is Δa and in b Δb , then <br>
    1.absolute error in calulation of x is Δx(difference  of a and b).<br>
    2.The maximum error in x =  = +-(Δa + Δb) .<br>
    3.Percentage error in value of x =  = ${(Δa + Δb)}/{a-b}$*100% .<br><br>
    Case :<b>x = a * b </b><br>
    let absolute error in a is Δa and in b Δb , then <br>

    2.The maximum fractional error in x is  ${Δx}/x$ = +-$({{Δa}/a} + {{Δb}/b})$ .<br>
    3.Percentage error in value of x = (%error in value of a) - (%error in value of b).<br><br>
    Case :<b>x = $a/b$</b><br>
    let absolute error in a is Δa and in b Δb , then <br>
    1.absolute error in calulation of x is Δx(division  of a and b).<br>
    2.The maximum fractional error in x is  ${Δx}/x$ = +-$({{Δa}/a} + {{Δb}/b})$ .<br>
    3.Percentage error in value of x = (%error in value of a) - (%error in value of b).<br><br>
    Case :<b>x = $a^n/b^m$</b><br>
    let absolute error in a is Δa and in b Δb , then <br>
    1.absolute error in calulation of x is Δx(division  of a and b).<br>
    2.The maximum fractional error in x is  ${Δx}/x$ = +-$(n{{Δa}/a} + m{{Δb}/b})$ .<br>
    3.Percentage error in value of x = (%error in value of a) - (%error in value of b).<br><br>
